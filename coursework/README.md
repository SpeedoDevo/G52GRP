> ## Supervisor's justification:
> Reasonably well written report that contains all the informatiuon needed. Reasonable explanation of the algorithms and the software design and structure.
>
> The software works as it should with a nice plain GUI. This was a difficult project tackled well.
>
> ## Second Marker's justification:
> Project Title: Neural Network Toolbox - Alfred  
> 65/70
>
> ### Justification of mark awarded:
>
> #### Overview (Problem description, background/literature review, references)
> The project is to create an easy to use neural network toolkit, accessible via a web interface, without needing any supporting environment (such as MATLAB / R). There is a good, comprehensive coverage of ANN literature, with good references.
>
> #### Methodology (Requirement specifications, design)
> The methodology for arriving at the requirements is somewhat opaque, as is the process of design. It is not clear whether anyone was consulted in creating the user-interface, and it is rather odd that Ch.3 starts with 'Updated User Interface', having not presented the initial user interface!
>
> #### Software Development (Discussion on implementation and testing)
> Again, there is a lot of focus on the ANN code itself, and very little on any surrounding code / functionality (the reading of data files, the input of parameters, the writing of outputs, etc.), so the whole process reads rather ad-hoc. It is difficult to appreciate how the whole system fits together, and to what degree it works, as there is lack of comparison against known benchmarks.
>
> #### Project Outcome (Summary of outcomes, completeness based on specifications)
> The group appears to have delivered a significant quantity of reasonable quality ANN code, which represents a significant achievement. It is not particularly clear how this addresses the original specifications, nor whether it all functions correctly (the testing / evaluation is rather vague).
>
> #### Project Management (Reflective comments on issues of group work)
> There is a reasonably honest reflection on the group work, although lack of specific detail makes it hard to judge how accurate this really is.
>
> #### Summary (Overall Comments):
> Overall, a good software product, with an impressive codebase. However, the written report has too much focus on the technical details of ANNs and too little higher-level information.

>
> ## Supervisor's justification for mark for individual report:
> A well written and well structured report but would have liked a bit more technical information to improve it overall.
>
> ## Second Marker's justification for mark for individual report:
> A good, well structured report, with good sections and honest, insightful reflections on how the project ran. Some of the claims are a bit grand and sweeping, but the details are good.
